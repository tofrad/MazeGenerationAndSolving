## Maze Generation & Solving

A repo to showcase different Mazegeneration- and Pathfinding-Algorithms, visualized with the help of raylib.

Goal is to create a connected Graph and giving the solving Algorithm only the starting cell. 

This is a work in progress.

Maze generated with Recursive Backtracking and solved with Deoth-First-Search(DFS)
