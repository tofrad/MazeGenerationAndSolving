## Maze Generation & Solving

A repo to showcase different Mazegeneration- and Pathfinding-Algorithms, visualized with the help of raylib.

Goal is to create a connected Graph and giving the solving Algorithm only the starting cell. 

This is a work in progress.

To be added:
  - Generators: Prims
  
  - Algorithms: A-Star, Dijkstra
  
  - UI to choose Generation and Pathfinding Algorithms
